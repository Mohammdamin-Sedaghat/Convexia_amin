# CRO Evaluation Summary

Based on our analysis of regulatory enforcement and clinical-trial performance data for 20 leading CROs over the past five years, here is a concise overview of the key insights. For more details please look at the end of the .ipynb file.

## Key Findings Across CROs

* **Low Enforcement Incidents**: The 20 CROs collectively received very few FDA Form 483s or warning letters in the last five years. This paucity makes regulatory flags a weak standalone measure of CRO reliability.

* **Inspection Frequency**: Each company averaged only 2–3 inspections annually, limiting the statistical power of inspection counts for scoring. Inspection officers sometimes hand‑record data, leading to under‑digitized records and gaps.

* **Trial Performance Variability**:

  * **Completion Delays**: Several CROs, notably Clinlogix and PSI CRO, consistently underestimated study timelines, with median completion delays exceeding several months.
  * **Dropout Rates**: Clinpace and George Clinical exhibited the highest median dropout rates, while Celerion and Veristat reported the lowest.

## Top Regulatory Violators vs. Best Performers

| Category                    | Companies                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Most Inspections**        | Syneos Health                                       |
| **High Completion Delays**  | Clinlogix, PSI CRO                                  |
| **High Dropout Rates**      | Clinpace, George Clinical                           |
| **Best Overall**            | Fortrea (moderate inspections, low delays/dropouts) |
| **Most Reliable in Trials** | Celerion, Veristat                                  |

## Limitations & Missing Data

1. **Sparse Enforcement Data**: Very few 483s and warning letters were issued, reducing differentiation power.
2. **Manual Reporting Gaps**: Some inspection records exist only in handwritten logs, excluding them from digitized datasets.
3. **Incomplete Trial Records**: Key CROs (e.g., IQVIA) did not publish full trial metadata, leading to missing `estimated_completion_date` or `dropout_rate` entries.
4. **Temporal Scope**: Focusing on the last five years may miss long‑term performance trends or recent remediation efforts.
